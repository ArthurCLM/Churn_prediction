# 1. Churn_prediction
This represents a end-to-end machine learning project employing XGBoost for forecasting the likelihood of customer churn within a credit card service offered by a bank. The detection of potential churners aids in devising retention strategies, ensuring a sustainable revenue stream.

# 2. Business problem and objectives
We aim to accomplist the following for this study:

- Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn:

- Build a prediction model that will perform the following:
  - Classify if a customer is going to churn or not.
  - Preferably and based on model performance, choose a model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target low hanging fruits in their efforts to prevent churn

# 3. Technologies and tools
The technologies and tools used were Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Category-Encoders, Scikit-Optimize, Xgboost), Jupyter Notebook, Git and Github (version control), machine learning classification algorithms, statistics, and Google Colab.
